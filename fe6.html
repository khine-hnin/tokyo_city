  <h3><p>History</p></h3>
The festival began in 1703 when the daimyō of Kishiwada, Okabe Nagayasu (岡部 長泰), prayed to Shinto gods for an abundant harvest at Fushimi Inari-taisha, Kyoto.

<h3><p>Summary</p></h3>
The Danjiri festival is divided principally into two festivals. The first is held in September and is the more famous of the two. The second occurs in October, is less famous but involves more Danjiri. The September Festival is itself divided in two. Again, the more famous is the Kishiwada danjiri centering on the Castle and runs from the Nankai line down to the seaside. The other Danjiri festival occurs in Haruki Town and centres on Nankai Haruki Station. The September Festival involves 34 Danjiri. In October the towns between the Nankai line and the mountains hold their own Danjiri Festivals. These involve 47 Danjiri and centre on the JR stations of Kumeda, Shimomatsu and Higashi-Kishiwada.

The city has 81 large wooden carts, each holding a portable shrine or danjiri.
